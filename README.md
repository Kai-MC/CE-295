# **Energy Systems and Control / Data Science for Energy**

Welcome to the repository for CE-295. Here, you'll find a collection of projects and resources related to the course.

## **Projects**
- **HW2:** Luenberger Observer & Kalman Filter
- **HW3:** Optimization
- **HW4:** Machine Learning & Forecasting
  - ARX time series
  - Neural networks

## **Background of HW4**
The data comes from [Green Button Data](http://www.greenbuttondata.org/), which comprises hourly electricity consumption records from over 20 residences located in the East Bay. In this project, I construct algorithms to forecast residential electricity consumption with data and machine learning (ML).

The model comparison presents as follows:
